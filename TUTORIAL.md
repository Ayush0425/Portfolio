# Portfolio Project Tutorial & Documentation

This document explains how this portfolio website was built, the features implemented, recent updates made, and how to maintain/update it moving forward using GitHub.

## 1. Project Setup
This project was built using **React** and **Vite** for a fast, modern development experience.

### Commands Used to Create:
```bash
npm create vite@latest .
# Selected: React, JavaScript
npm install
npm install lucide-react # For icons
```

## 2. Key Features Implemented

### 🎨 Design System
- **Variables**: CSS variables in `index.css` for consistent colors (Primary, Surface, Text).
- **Dark/Light Mode**: Implemented in `ThemeToggle.jsx`. It toggles a `data-theme` attribute on the `<html>` tag.
- **Responsive**: Flexbox and Grid layouts that adapt to mobile and desktop screens.

### 🧩 Components
- **Navbar**: Sticky navigation with smooth scrolling to sections.
- **Hero**: Introduction section with a "Hire Me" CTA and social links.
- **Projects**: Grid layout displaying project cards with hover effects.
- **Education**: Timeline view of your academic background.
- **Contact**: Simple contact form layout.
- **ScrollReveal**: A wrapper component that animates elements as they enter the viewport.

## 3. Recent Updates (What We Changed)

### ✅ Removing "Nike Project"
- **Goal**: Remove the old "Nike Shoes Website" project as requested.
- **Action**: 
    - Deleted the project object from `src/components/Projects.jsx`.
    - Removed the text mention from `src/components/Education.jsx`.
    - Pushed changes to GitHub to clean up the repo.

### ✅ Adding "Portfolio Project"
- **Goal**: Add this current portfolio code as a featured project.
- **Action**:
    - Added a new object to the `projects` array in `Projects.jsx` with your repository link (`https://github.com/Ayush0425/Portfolio`).

### 🔧 Fixing Image Paths (Essential Lesson!)
- **Problem**: You used a local path (`C:\Users\...`) for an image. This works *only* on your computer.
- **Solution**: 
    - Moved the image to the `public/projects/` folder.
    - Updated code to use the relative path: `/projects/netflix-bg.jpg`.
    - **Rule**: Always put images in `public` or `src/assets` and use relative paths so they work on the web!

## 4. GitHub Workflow (How to Save & Update)

You are using **Git** for version control. Here is the exact workflow to save your changes and update your live website.

### Step 1: Status Check
Check what files have changed:
```bash
git status
```

### Step 2: Stage Changes
Prepare all modified files for saving:
```bash
git add .
```

### Step 3: Save (Commit)
Save the snapshot of your code with a message explaining what you did:
```bash
git commit -m "Description of what I changed"
```

### Step 4: Upload (Push)
Send your saved changes to GitHub. This usually triggers your hosting provider to update the live site.
```bash
git push origin main
```

## 5. How to Run Locally
If you restart your computer, here is how to start working again:

1. Open VS Code in the project folder.
2. Open the terminal (`Ctrl + ~`).
3. Run:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
4. Click the "Local" link (e.g., `http://localhost:5173`) to view your site.
